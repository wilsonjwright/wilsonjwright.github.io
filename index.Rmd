I am an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Missouri.
I joined MU in the Fall of 2024 after completing my PhD at Colorado State University.
My [research](research.html) interests are in spatial statistics and Bayesian statistics,
in particular for applications in ecology and environmental science.
