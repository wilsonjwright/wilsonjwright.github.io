title: "Continuous-space occupancy models"
---

Occupancy models are commonly used to map the distribution of a species while accounting for imperfect detection.
While the species occurrence process is generally assumed to have a continuous support, occupancy data are collected at areal survey units.
During my PhD, I developed the first occupancy model to include a change of spatial support.
This is beneficial because it allows for more realistic models about the species occurrence process while still properly accounting for the discrete spatial support of the observed data.
This model also allows for only a portion of a site to be occupied and relates the probability of detecting a species to these within-site occupancy proportions.
